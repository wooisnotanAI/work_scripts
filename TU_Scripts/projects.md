Different project ideas:

1. Automating cashout posts to post on discord
-- custom discord bot, upgrading and moving Kong Bot to a local VPS.
2. Simpler launcher for tabs + UA reporting
3. Simple script launcher for work from bash.


- Scripts to fully automate cashout audit processes using selenium
- Scripts to fully automate Bug reports from users to different reports (leverages databases) + custom reporting and web hosting.
- Scripts / chatbots to fully automate zendesk replies
- Scripts / chatbots to fully automate social posting / tournament recaps (using OCR and scroll down to simulate logging in / credentials)

- Daily script runner that runs once a month; 
- - This also will need secure ways to store keys (API and passwords / credentials)
- - As well as methods to notify me when this script is down; and local / backups to re-start / re activate things.
